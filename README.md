# cs310-csv-json
This assignment was intended to give me experience with two of the standard plain-text data formats that are commonly used for 
data interchange: CSV, and JSON.  
In this assignment, I created converters to translate a specific kind of data (course grade data) to and from the 
CSV and JSON formats.  
This assignment will also give me experience with using the Git client and the JUnit testing framework within an IDE.
CSV stands for "Comma-Separated Values", and it is used to represent tabular data (like you would find in a spreadsheet).
SON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation", and it is used as a general-purpose format for many kinds of data, 
particularly in Web-based applications.
My task for this project was to complete the two conversion methods given in the Converter.java program file: csvToJson(), 
which converts a CSV string to the corresponding JSON string, and jsonToCsv(), which converts a JSON string into the 
corresponding CSV string.
